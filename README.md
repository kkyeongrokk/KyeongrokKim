  I am a dedicated software engineer who recently relocated from Korea to pursue an exciting career in the field. With a background in the military, I have learned the value of teamwork and communication, enabling me to thrive in collaborative environments. Outside of work, I lead and captain a tennis team, demonstrating my leadership and team-building skills. I am a people person who enjoys connecting with others and building genuine relationships. My passion lies in web development, where I focus on creating innovative and user-centric solutions.
